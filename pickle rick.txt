1:03-> nmap scan
1:03 -> Discovered SSH and HTTP ports open
1:04 -> Visited website
1:04 ->inspected code, USERNAME: R1ckRul3s
1:04 -> Starting dir buster
1:13 -> found robots.txt file, login/portal
1:14 -> robots.txt had a fake key
1:16 -> captured login prompt- username=R1ckRul3s&password=lol&sub=Login using burpsuite
1:18 -> tried to use Hydra then remembered the robots.txt fake key., worked as password
1:19 -> logged in, the site shows several pages, only the commands page is accessible, commands page lets me run Linux commands
1:25 -> found the first key text file, does not let me cat, will try do a reverse shell
1:29 -> reverse shell failed, but realised i can do ip/filename which revealed first key: mr. meeseek hair
1:30 -> found a clue file while doing ls -a
1:33 -> The clue was to look around the file system, not very helpful
1:57 -> After struggling, I found Rick directory, and although cat doesn't work, 'less' works: 1 jerry tear
1:59 -> used sudo -l to see what privileges i had, then after realising i had all, used sudo to go to root folder, saw 3rd.txt there, and upon lessing it, i got the 3rd key:fleeb juice
